Snake!

This project is my take on the retro game Snake! This program leverages the pygame module to set-up and carry out the main functions of the game.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake and guide it towards the food block. After each block is eaten, the snake will grow in size. Be careful not to run into the edges of the display or into the snakes body, because if you do, it's game over!
