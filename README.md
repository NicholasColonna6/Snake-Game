# Snake!

This project is my take on the retro game Snake! This was my first time using the pygame module to set-up and carry out the functions of a game.

### How to Play
1. Download and run the game from the command line `python snake_game.py`
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake and guide it towards the food block
3. The game will begin at first press of an arrow key on your keyboard
4. Once the snake run's into the food black and "eats" the food, the snake will grow in size
5. The game ends when you either run into the edge of the display or run into the body of your snake
6. When the game ends, you can elect to Quit 'Q' or Play Again 'Space'
